# HomeShare (frontend)

A self-hosted application that lives locally, making it easy to share files and information with other computers in the network.

## USAGE WARNING

This application is not designed to be hosted online. Ideally, this should be hosted on a local machine that only accepts local connections. Online applications require many security features to make sure that data is protected from unauthorized access and bad actors. This application has little to none of that, because it's meant to be run locally, where only trusted devices can access.
